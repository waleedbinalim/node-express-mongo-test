# Node Express and Mongo Test

The following repository is me testing out NodeJS, Express and Mongo Atlas Database to creat a blog application. The project is almost a clone with minor tweaks from the one made in the tutorial series by TheNetNinja's NodeJS playlist series. The series helped cover topics and technologies mentioned below

- NodeJS Basics (Global Object, Modules & Require, File System, Streams and Buffers)

- Clients and Servers

- Request and Response

- Express and View Engines (EJS)

- MongoDB, Mongoose, Models and Schema

- GET PUT & DELETE Requests

- Express Router and MVC
